## Overview

This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR - Specially for Pakistan Number Plates) system using [Framework/Library names, e.g., OpenCV, YOLO, Flask etc.]. The system is designed to recognize and extract license plate information from images or video streams.

## Features

- **License Plate Detection:** Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms to detect license plates in images or video frames.
- **Character Recognition:** Applies optical character recognition (OCR) to extract characters from license plates.
- **Video Processing:** Supports real-time processing of video streams for continuous ANPR.

## Getting Started
